# Security Policy

The maintainers of the _JavaScript Regex Security Scanner_ project take security
issues seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your
findings. Due to the non-funded and open-source nature of the project, we take a
best-efforts approach when it comes to engaging with security reports.

This document should be considered expired after 2026-01-01. If you are reading
this after that date you should try to find an up-to-date version in the
official source repository.

## Supported Versions

The table below shows which versions of the project are currently supported

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue in the latest version of a supported version range,

To report a security issue in an unsupported version of the project, or if the

publicly. For example, as a regular issue in the public repository. If in doubt,
report the issue privately.

### Threat Model

The scanner considers Docker, ESLint, and its plugins to be trusted. All inputs
are considered untrusted. Any violation of confidentiality, integrity, and
availability is considered a security issue.

The project considers the GitHub infrastructure and all project maintainers to
be trusted. Any action performed on the repository by any other GitHub user is
considered untrusted.

> **NOTE:** Advisories will be created only for vulnerabilities present in
> released versions of the project.
