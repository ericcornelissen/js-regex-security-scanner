## Reporting a Vulnerability

The maintainers of the _JavaScript Regex Security Scanner_ take security bugs
very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your
findings. Due to the non-funded open-source nature of this project, we take a
best-efforts approach when it comes to engaging with (security) reports.

To report a security issue in a supported version of the project, send an email
to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] and include the words "SECURITY" and
"js-re-scan" in the subject line. Please do not open a regular issue or Pull
Request in the public repository.
