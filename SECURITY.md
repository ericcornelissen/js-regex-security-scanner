## Reporting a Vulnerability

The maintainers of the JavaScript Regex Security Scanner take security bugs very
seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings. Due
to the non-funded open-source nature of this project, we take a best-efforts
approach when it comes to engaging with (security) reports.

To report a security issue in a supported version of the JavaScript Regex
Security Scanner, send an email to [security@ericcornelissen.dev] and include
the words _"SECURITY"_ and _"js-re-scan"_ in the subject line. Please do not
open a regular issue or Pull Request in the public repository.

If you found a security bug in an unsupported version of the JavaScript Regex
Security Scanner, please report this publicly. For example, as a regular issue
in the public repository.
